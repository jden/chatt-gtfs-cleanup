## What it does

This script attempts to automatically correct some validation errors in the GTFS files generated by BusTools.

### Route Short Name Is Contained In Long Name
Removes duplicated information in routes.txt

### Invalid values in shape_pt_sequence
Fixes improperly formatted values in shapes.txt

### Trip Headsign Contains Route Short Name
### Trip Headsign Contains Route Long Name
Removes duplicated information in trips.txt

## Troubleshooting

### No output is displayed
If there are no corrections made, nothing will print in the script output. Check the files in the destination directory; they should be present & valid.

### Files missing in output directory
The script only copies over files which it knows how to clean up. You can copy over the rest of the files which make up a GTFS feed from the input directory unchanged.
